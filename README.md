# Node.js & MongoDB Demo

This repository showcases a sample application that demonstrates the use of MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database. It also highlights how MongoDB can be used to handle multimedia content, specifically audio files.

The project includes both the **frontend** and **backend** of an audiobook streaming platform.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Contains the server-side logic and API integration with MongoDB.
- `frontend/`: Contains the client-side interface for interacting with the platform.

## Setup Instructions

Instructions for setting up and running each part of the application can be found in the respective `README.md` files inside the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
