## Setting Up the Frontend

Follow the steps below to set up and start the frontend:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**  
   Ensure you are in the frontend directory by running:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/frontend
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server**  
   Run the following command to start the frontend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the Frontend**  
   Once the server is running, navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:3000` or as specified in the terminal output).

4. **Store the URL for Backend Configuration**  
   Save the frontend URL for use in the backend. You will need to add this URL as an environment variable (`FRONTEND_URL`) in the backend `.env` file.

5. **Frontend Running**  
   The frontend should now be running and ready to serve requests!
